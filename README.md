### Introduction

This project dives into a dataset from a Portuguese bank's marketing efforts to predict whether customers will sign up for term deposits. Using machine learning, we want to find insights that can help the bank improve how they market these deposits and get more people to subscribe.

### Dataset

The dataset includes data from over 41,000 customer interactions, covering 21 different details like age, marital status, education, job type, and past campaign outcomes. Our main goal is to predict if a customer will say 'yes' or 'no' to a term deposit based on these factors.

### What We Did

1. **Getting Started:**
   - First, we loaded the dataset from a file.
   - We looked at the data to see what kinds of information we had and if any information was missing.

2. **Exploring the Data:**
   - We used graphs to see things like how ages are distributed among customers, what kinds of jobs they have, and how these relate to whether they signed up for a deposit before.

3. **Getting the Data Ready:**
   - We had to change some types of data so our computer could understand it better.
   - We split the data into parts to teach our computer on some data and to see if it learned well on the data it didn't know.

4. **Making the Models:**
   - We used different kinds of tools to teach our computer how to guess if someone would sign up for a deposit.
   - After that, we checked which tool was the best for making these guesses.

5. **Seeing How Good Our Guesses Were:**
   - We checked a lot of ways to see how well our tools made guesses, like how often they were right and how sure they were when they were right.
   - We made reports and pictures to show how well our tools worked.

### What We Found

- We found one tool that was very good at guessing who would sign up for a deposit.
- This tool was best at saying 'yes' when someone would sign up.

### What Was Hard

- Sometimes, we didn't have enough information to teach our tools how to guess well.
- We also had to be careful to not teach our tools too much about the wrong things.

### What We Learned

This tool can help banks figure out who might sign up for their deposits. With this information, banks can do a better job of letting people know about their deposits and getting more people to sign up.

### How You Can Do This Too

1. Make sure you have the right programs installed on your computer.
2. Put the dataset file (called `bank-additional-full.csv`) in the same folder as where you have your programs.
3. Use the instructions we wrote to look at the data and make guesses of your own.
